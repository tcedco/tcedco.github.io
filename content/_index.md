Welcome to Codects, a collection of technical notes and articles researched and written by me, Sami Elsayed. Here, once or twice a month, I share deep dives into things that interest me in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer security, hardware, and even debate.

## About Me

I'm a first-year student at George Mason University studying computer science, computer engineering, and mathematics. Outside of academics, I debate for the George Mason Debate Team, where I  compete in policy debate tournaments across the country.
