I don't care what people say, `vim` is objectively better than `nano` for text editing. Here are my few personal reasons why:

1. **Efficiency**: `vim`'s modal editing allows for faster text manipulation without constantly moving your hands away from the keyboard.
2. **Extensibility**: `vim` has a vast ecosystem of plugins and customization options that let you tailor your editing environment to your exact needs.
3. **Skill Development**: Learning `vim` can improve your overall typing and navigation skills, making you a more proficient coder.

I think that using `nano` is fine for quick edits and for beginners, but once you get a few months of experience, `vim`'s advantages become much more clearer in my opinion.
