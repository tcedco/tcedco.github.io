Hello! I'm Sami Elsayed, a student at George Mason University studying computer science and computer engineering. My interests lie within the realms of computer security, hardware, and artificial intelligence.

I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 2025, where I studied artificial intelligence and computer vision. My senior research project evolved around optimizing AI workloads within heterogenous computing environments.

Currently as a undergraduate, I am a debater on the George Mason Debate Team, where I compete in policy debate tournaments across the country. I also am members of the Mason Competitive Cyber club (MasonCC), and AI Club.

You can find me as [@elsayedcodes](https://x.com/elsayedcodes) on X and as well as on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elsayedcodes/). My GitHub profile is [@selsayed25](https://github.com/selsayed25).
